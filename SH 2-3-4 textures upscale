Hi there!
Can we go for upscaled textures in SH2/3/4?
I tried to use SH textures explorer:
https://www.silenthillmemories.net/sh2/modding/sh_texture_explorer_2.1.rar
But it can only replace textures in original sizes (512x512 etc.), can we use bigger resolutions somehow?
I saw this:

but this “Umod” can done only 2x upscale, and only for addon =(
